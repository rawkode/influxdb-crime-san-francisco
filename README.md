# San Francisco Crime Data to Influx Cloud 2

## Download Data

You can download the 2018-Present data:

https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783

There is also data from 2003-2018, but the quality of the data isn't as good. I may process this later.

## Convert Data to "Clean" CSV

`python convertToCleanCsv.py`
